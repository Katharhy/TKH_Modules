1. What is Git and how is it different than Github

Git is the actual repository (e.g., folder) that can contain a series of nested folders and files. It help to keep count on all the updates or changes made to the folders and/or folder. On the other hand, Github is a displayer for the repositories like Finder (Mac) or Explorer (Windows) that displays the content (e.g., repositories). The changes to the content is recored with Git, and those changes are displayed with Github. 
 
2. Why use the terminal?

As a programmer, it is important to "communicate" with the computer on the same "language." The terminal behaves as a direct intermediator to chat with the computer through the command followed by the program, option, and arguments. Also, it is essential to become familiar with the style and culture of writing in a terminal since a programer will spend a surprising amount of time in similar environment.     

3. Explain 3 benefits version control in your own words 

A) It assists with record keeping, which is fundamental to understand the progress of a project. Version control acknowledges changes and enable to go back and check for changes made to a repository (e.g., files inside the repo).

B) It provides the ability to share/create branches and/or forks of projects to collaborate with a team. Teams are capable to clone the repo into their individual computers and keep an updated record of the work through version control. So, every member in the team can be on the same length of the progress in each project. 

C) It keeps programmers organized. With so many files moving though our computers, version control compiles files in one organized place from where one can retrieve or share files with others.
