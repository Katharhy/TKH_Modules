            <p> I have arrived in this program to learn skills as foreign to me as it is unfamiliar to you, the Amazon. It is false to say that I dream of chatting with a computer since, until recently, I was ignorant about computers and its multifunctionality. Curiosity drives my goals and hobbies. I aim to apply these skills to conduct life science research design, analysis, communication, and knowledge application. I find exhilarating to experience new subjects, meet likeminded individuals, and generate social change through conquering ignorance. I enjoy the art and science of coffee - I have become a coffee enthusiast - growing, roasting, and brewing it. Also, I enjoy playing soccer more than watching a match.</p>
